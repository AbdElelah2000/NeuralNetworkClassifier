# NeuralNetworkClassifier
Custom Neural Network classifier

involves building a neural network classifier with two hidden layers for binary classification using the banknote authentication dataset. The task includes data splitting, feature standardization, ReLU activation function, training with average cross-entropy loss using stochastic gradient descent, and selecting the optimal number of units in the hidden layers via validation. The results are presented in a report, including the chosen model configuration, cross-entropy loss, misclassification error, learning curve, and potential improvements.
